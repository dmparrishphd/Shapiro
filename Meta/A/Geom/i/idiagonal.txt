idiagonal

Vertices of Diagonals of Polygons

Description

        Return indices of vertices of diagonals of polygons.

Usage

        idiagonal(nsides, ivertex=1L, jdiagonal=1L)

Arguments

    nsides

        the number of sides of a concave polygon

    ivertex

        indices of polygon vertices

    jdiagonal

        indices of diagonals proceeding from the ivertex-th
        vertices

Details

        Designed for the following conditions:

                nsides, ivertex, and jdiagonal are `integer`
                vectors.

                3 < nsides

                1 <= ivertex <= nsides

                jdiagonal <= nsides - 3

        The above conditions are *not* enforced.

Value

        Provided that design conditions are met:
        An integer vector containing the indices of the vertices
        opposite (along diagonals) ivertex. The particular
        opposite vertices are determined by jdiagonal.

        Each line segment from an ivertex-th vertex to the
        corresponding return-th vertex is a diagonal of the
        polygon.

        If both ivertex and jdiagonal are vectors of indices of
        equal length (including length 1), the return will
        contain the indices corresponding to matched pairs of
        elements of ivertex and jdiagonal.

        If either ivertex or jdiagonal are of length 1 and the
        other is of length greater than one, the return will
        contain the indices correpsonding to each combination
        of ivertex and jdiagonal.

Examples

        idiagonal(4, 1, 1)
        # [1] 3
        idiagonal(4, 1:2, 1)
        # [1] 4 1
        idiagonal(5, 1:5, 1)
        # [1] 3 4 5 1 2

        # The following should draw a five-pointed star on a new device:
        a <- seq(from=2*pi/5, to=2*pi, by=2*pi/5) + pi/2
        pp <- cbind(cos(a), sin(a))
        dev.new()
        image(c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), matrix(1), col=NA, asp=1)
        i <- cbind(1:5, idiagonal(5, 1:5, 1))
        for (k in seq(nrow(i))) lines(pp[i[k,], ])
