# Organization

There is no real structure to the arrangement of files herein.
Files are grouped by "level", then by name.
I use "level" loosely: definitions at one level might use definitions at lower levels.
However, this is not a strict rule.

# Stop "Maintaining" Software

["Travel through space without moving," instead.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dune_(film))

I do not intend ever to change any of these **R** files: It is not necessary. (I _do_ intend to revise documentation, including the present files).
If a correction is needed because `foo` in file `foo.R` is in error, I will create another `foo` in file `foo.1.R`.
Users who want to stick with their `foo` defined in `foo.R` and not use `foo.1.R` are welcome to do so.
