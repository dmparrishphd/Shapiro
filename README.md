Shapiro
=======

**Shapiro is a library** of functions for writing concise code.

**Shapiro is for GIS** (geographic information systems) and related domains, including
data analysis and numerical modelling (mostly pre- and post-processing).

**Shapiro is 100% organic**: it grows as I am charged with or otherwise become interested in particular computational tasks.

Forthcoming: Suggested configurations.

Organization
------------

Now (2020-01-30) that the reorganization is complete,
I intend that the _R code_ under the
[Files](./Files),
[Mirrors](./Mirrors), and
[Pkgs](./Pkgs)
will never change and will never move.
The file names and paths, _relavive to the repository root_, are fixed.
A discipline like this is necessary for reliability and
[reproducibility](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science).

**Shapiro changes by the addition** of new files,
_not_ by breaking code and mutilating existing files.

I do _not_ promise to adhere to the same discipline for all _other types of files_.
Markdown (extension .md) files, in particular are volatile,
although I do not anticipate deleting any Markdown files.
Allowing for volatility in the Markdown files allows me to make changes to the documentation,
e.g., to better represent what the code is doing.
