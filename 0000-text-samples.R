    "Britain, an island in the Atlantic, formerly called Albion,
    lies to the north-west, facing, though at a considerable
    distance, the coasts of Germany, France, and Spain, which
    form the greatest part of Europe. It extends 800 miles in
    length towards the north, and is 200 miles in breadth,
    except where several promontories extend further in breadth,
    by which its compass is made to be 4,875 miles. To the south
    lies Belgic Gaul. To its nearest shore there is an easy
    passage from the city of Rutubi Portus, by the English now
    corrupted into Reptacaestir. The distance from here across
    the sea to Gessoriacum, the nearest shore in the territory
    of the Morini, is fifty miles, or as some writers say, 450
    furlongs. On the other side of the island, where it opens
    upon the boundless ocean, it has the islands called Orcades.
    Britain is rich in grain and trees, and is well adapted for
    feeding cattle and beasts of burden. It also produces vines
    in some places, and has plenty of land and water fowl of
    divers sorts; it is remarkable also for rivers abounding in
    fish, and plentiful springs. It has the greatest plenty of
    salmon and eels; seals are also requently taken, and
    dolphins, as also whales; besides many sorts of shell-fish,
    such as mussels, in which are often found excellent pearls
    of all colours, red, purple, violet and green, but chiefly
    white. There is also a great abundance of snails, of which
    the scarlet dye is made, a most beautiful red, which never
    fades with the heat of the sun or exposure to rain, but the
    older it is, the more beautiful it becomes. It has both salt
    and hot springs, and from them flow rivers which furnish hot
    baths, proper for all ages and both sexes, in separate
    places, according to their requirements. For water, as St.
    Basil says, receives the quality of heat, when it runs along
    certain metals, and becomes not only hot but scalding.
    Britain is rich also in veins of metals, as copper, iron,
    lead, and silver; it produces a great deal of excellent jet,
    which is black and sparkling, and burns when put to the
    fire, and when set on fire, drives away serpents; being
    warmed with rubbing, it attracts whatever is applied to it,
    like amber. The island was formerly distinguished by
    twenty-eight famous cities, besides innumerable forts, which
    were all strongly secured with walls, towers, gates, and
    bars.  And, because it lies almost under the North Pole, the
    nights are light in summer, so that at midnight the
    beholders are often in doubt whether the evening twilight
    still continues, or that of the morning has come; since the
    sun at night returns to the east in the northern regions
    without passing far beneath the earth.  For this reason the
    days are of a great length in summer, and on the other hand,
    the nights in winter are eighteen hours long, for the sun
    then withdraws into southern parts. In like manner the
    nights are very short in summer, and the days in winter,
    that is, only six equinoctial hours. Whereas, in Armenia,
    Macedonia, Italy, and other countries of the same latitude,
    the longest day or night extends but to fifteen hours, and
    the shortest to nine." # * Endnote marks and pagination info removed.
