Metadata for Directory

Description

        Subdirectories are intended to correspond with users,
        groups, data stewards, etc.

        Content of subdirectories are up to the user, etc.,
	but the intent is that they contain specifications of
	library trees corresponding with the libtree.dir keys of
	ShapiroXF configuration files. See the DMP/ subdirectory
	for examples.
