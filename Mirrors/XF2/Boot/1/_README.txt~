        One theory suggests that it derives  from
        Shpira,  the Hebrew/ Yiddish name for Spira...
        pronounced Shpira, which is an Aramaic borrowed
        word meaning "handsome."*

        Shapiro XF is DESIGNED to give you a clean-slate
        R setup with the tools you select.
 
        ShapiroXF is a boot loader for an R session. it
        is DESIGNED to be called near R start-up, and
        will **** `detach` **** items from the search
        path and **** remove (`rm`) **** items from the
        global environment.

        The return from a successful boot with ShapiroXF
        is a two column character matrix. Column 1
        contains the filenames of the R files
        `source`-d. Column 2 contains the cumulative
        count (converted to character) of items loaded
        from each file. Column 1 might be used to search
        the source code. Column 2 might be used to
        partially verify that components were loaded
        properly.

++ This series does not attempt to present even all of my
computable problems, let alone solutions to them (for one
thing, this series is restricted to problems for which I
think R is a good tool for attempted solutions).
** Of course, not all problems are computable. For those
problems, there are other approaches. See, e.g., Donald
Knuth (2009-03-16) Talks at Google. YouTube JPpk-1btGZk .


INTRODUCTION

THE PRESENT TEXT is largely a copy of that found in my earlier
shapir.R.

FOR A SAMPLE INSTALLATION of ShapiroXF, see the accompanying
file _SAMPLE_INSTALL.txt .

THE NAME. In many regex systems, the period (.) can stand for
any character; if we choose "o," we get "Shapiro." Additionally,
"shapirr" is an anagram for my surname. The "XF" stands for
"eXtreme Factorization" or "eXtremely Factored." The goal, not
yet fully realized, is for components to be factored down to
irreducible complexity, like individual building blocks.

THE AUDIENCE I hope to communicate with herein is, foremost, my
future self (see Abstract). However, I hope also to provide for
the beginner or intermediate programmer, and for beginner R
programmer some examples of the kinds of things that can be done
in R. Additionally, I invite the vicious, constructive criticism
of experienced programmers: I want a useful, robust system that
works.

THE PROBLEMS that I work on most often center on pre- and
post-processing of numerical and simple text data associated
with numerical modelling.

THE SOURCE CODE is what you are reading now. This part of the
source code is a character string with which R will do almost
nothing: it is effectively a comment. The rest of the source
code should be found in the present directory and
subdirectories, as well as distributed throughout the SFWMD
network.

THE USER IS FREE to load any libraries and source any code. I
have developed several packages and what I call proto packages
(files to be sourced rather than installed and `library`-ed).



TODO

        Enable viewing of licences, etc., found in
        subdirectories of Shapiro directory.

        Introduce something like Compute Capability or allow
        user to load one file, which will then load other files
        as needed.


TERMINOLOGY

        array index
        
                an index into an array. see also "matrix index."
        
        index matrix

                a matrix of indices, defined in ?`[[`. not to be
                confused with "matrix index."

        matrix index

                an index into a matrix. not to be confused with
                "index matrix."

        proto-package

                a file or files that could be used to create an
                R package. Typically, such files can be `source`d.
                

CONVENTIONS*

            *   Conventions apply to packages and
                protopackages by DMP---though not with
                absolute consistency---(of course not).

        Phonocentrism: functions names may have meaning
        according to the sound of their names.
                Brevity: short words good; long words bad.
        Better a hundred one-line functions than one,
        one-hundred--line function. Better one function
        definition and two function calls than duplicate
        statements.
                Cosmopolitanism: function names may be borrowed
        from other languages, particularly French (Fr.), Latin
        (Lt.), Greek (Gr.), and German (De.)
                Endianness: Where there is not an obvious choice
        to the contrary, we generally prefer little endian,
        since, "Little endian is the correct endianness, anyway"
        [STM].
                Inclusivity: Ranges of elements are inclusive,
        as is the R default (e.g., (1:9)[1:2] returns a
        two-elment vector).
                Integers: The integers strictly greater than
        zero will be considered the natural numbers. R begins
        indexing with 1 by default.
                Multiline Comments are sometimes indicated per
        the example below, at EXMAPLE OF MULTILINE COMMENT.
                Natural Numbers (see Integers).
                Ordering: The term "sorted", unless otherwise
        specified, means "sorted in ascending order."
                Tradition: names for e.g., function names,
        formal parameter names, and the like, are borrowed from
        other programming languages: C, Fortran, and Python, in
        particular.
                Vector-centric: functions both receiving and
        returning vectors have no type-prefixes or type
        suffixes.

APPENDIX: ShapiroXF USAGE EXAMPE---TESTED on R 3.5.3

        BOOT.INFO <-
        source("//ad.sfwmd.gov/dfsroot/data/worm/Files/COMP/SOFTWARE/ShapiroXF2/Boot/1/boot.R")[[1]](
            "//ad.sfwmd.gov/dfsroot/data/worm/Files/COMP/SOFTWARE/ShapiroXF2/Boot/1/Config/DMP/6.csv")
 
(assuming present directory is R:/ShapiroXF/)
 
        BOOT.INFO <- source("R:/ShapiroXF/boot.R")[[1]](
            "R:/ShapiroXF-Configs/Config/1.csv")
 
The above example `source`-s the boot.r file, takes the first
item (a boot loader function) and passes your configuration file
(actually the name of the configuration file) to the boot loader.
 
The configuration file is a CSV file with a header and two
columns. All values are quoted. example:
 
**** BEGIN **** EXAMPLE CSV CONFIGURATION FILE
"key","value"
"dir.where.installed","r:/shapiroxf/"
"libtree.dir","r:/shapiroxf-configs/libtree/1/"
"proto.pkg.config.file","r:/shapiroxf-configs/protopkg/1.ini"
**** END **** EXAMPLE CSV CONFIGURATION FILE
 
The column names are not significant, but must be present.  The
keys are significant: These become argument names.  The values
are significant.
 
The first two values tell where the installation of ShapiroXF is
located (you may have multiple installations) and where your
library tree is located (ShapiroXF will attempt to load the
corresponding libraries). These first two items represent
directories, and the terminal path separator (/) must be
included.
 
The third value is the full path to your configuration file.
ShapiroXF will attempt to source all of the corresponding R
files into the `ShapirEnv` environment, which will be created.

The return (stored as info) in the example, is described
in the front matter.
