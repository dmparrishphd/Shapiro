Metadata for Directory

Description

        Subdirectories are intended to correspond with users,
        groups, data stewards, etc.

        Content of subdirectories are up to the user, etc., but
        the intent is that they contain specifications of proto
        packages (R files to be `source`d) corresponding with
        the proto.pkg.config.file keys of ShapiroXF
        configuration files. See the DMP/ subdirectory for
        examples.
