Metadata for Directory

Description

        It is intended that the structure of this directory
        match that of ../../../Nominal1.

        Each .R file (leaf of the directory tree) under
        ../../../Nominal1 **** may **** have a corresponding
        **** subdirectory **** under the present directory.
        That subdirectory is intended to contain one or more
        readme files that pertain to the corresponding .R file.
        Multiple readmes for the same .R file are planned: there
        may be translations, attachments, etc.

Example

        ./0001/i/isodates.mdy/ matches
        ../../../Nominal1/0001/i/isodates.mdy.R
