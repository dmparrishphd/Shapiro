icommon

DESCRIPTION

        icommon returns an integer index valid for all vectors
        of the given lengths.

USAGE

        icommon(...)

ARGUMENTS

        ...     lengths of hypothetical vectors.

DETAILS

        Given the lengths of several hypothetical vectors,
        returns the longest, sorted (ascending) integer index
        that is composed of the first few natural numbers and
        that is valid for all of the hypothetical vectors. The
        return indicates those indices that are common to all of
        the hypothetical vectors.
