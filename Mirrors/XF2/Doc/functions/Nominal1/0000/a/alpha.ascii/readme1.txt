#    (3) # Unicode name
#    (4) # PostScript character name
#  
#  General Notes:
# 
#    The Unicode values in this table were produced as the result of applying
#    the algorithm described in the section "Populating a Unicode space" in the
#    document "Unicode and Glyph Names," at
#    http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/typeforum/unicodegn.html
#    to the characters encoded in Adobe Standard Encoding. Note that some
#    Standard Encoding characters, such as "space", are mapped to 2 Unicode
#    values. Refer to the above document for more details.

#  Revision History:
#
#    [v1.0, 2011 July 12]

#    Updated contact information and document link.
#    No changes to the mapping data.
#
#    [v0.2, 30 March 1999]
#    Different algorithm to produce Unicode values (see notes above) results in
#    some character codes being mapped to 2 Unicode values. Updated Unicode
#    names to Unicode 2.0 names.
