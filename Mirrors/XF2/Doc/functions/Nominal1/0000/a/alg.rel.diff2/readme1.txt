alg.rel.diff2

DESCRIPTION

        Algebraic relative difference

USAGE

        alg.rel.diff2(x, y)

ARGUMENTS

    `x`, `y`

        Numeric vectors of equal length.

VALUE

        A numeric matrix with one row per element of `x`. The
        first column holds the numerators of the algebraic
        relative differences, while the second column holds the
        denominators.
