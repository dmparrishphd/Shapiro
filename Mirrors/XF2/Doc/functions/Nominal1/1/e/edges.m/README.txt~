edges.m

DESCRIPTION

edges.m returns the edges of its matrix argument, interpreted as
a raster.

USAGE

        edges.m(m)

ARGUMENTS

        m       a matrix

DETAILS

        Differences (`diff`) between adjacent elements are
        computed. Nonzero differences correspond with edges in
        the return.

        The return `Y` is a data frame suitable for the call

                do.call(segments, Y)
