                        Locating Points
                        Relative to the
                      Cells of a Quadmesh

For the purposes of determining a unique cell of a quadmesh
within which any given point may be said to belong, number the
nodes of any given cell 1, 2, 3, and 4 proceeding counter-
clockwise (right-hand rule). Additionally, number every cell's
nodes such that every node receives a unique index (1, 2, 3, 4)
from each cell, and that, when poceeding counterclockwise around
a node, the indices encountered for each cell sharing that node
proceed in ascending order.

Let line 1 pass through points 1 and 2, and let line 4 pass
through points 4 and 1.

Then, a point belongs to a cell if and only if it is:

        not completely outside the cell (i.e., it is either
        completely within or on the boundary of the cell),

        not on line 2, and
        
        not on line 3.

Otherwise, the point in question does not belong to the cell
under consideration.

In the accompanying figure, Point 1 belongs to the cell
depicted, as do Points A and D. However, Points, 2, 3, and 4 do
not, nor do points B and C; rather, these other points belong to
the neighbors of the cell depicted.
