Description

        A two-column table which describes the location of the
        .R file ("FILE" column) in which the corresponding
        SYMBOL (column 1) is bound to an object (usually a
        function, sometimes a value).

        The paths included with FILE assume a prefix of
        ../../../Nominal1 (relative to the present directory.)

Development Plan

        As elements of Shapiro are copied to their own files, it
        is planned that src.csv will be appended with the
        corresponding information.

        It is intended that only those .R files containing a
        single assignment statement are to be included. In this
        way, the corresponding file may be sourced in order to
        bind exactly one symbol to an object, facilitating fine
        refactoring.
